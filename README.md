## About Markdown Headers

<img src="./assets/preview.gif" alt="Preview GIF" width="500px" align="right" style="padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;">

Markdow Headers is a lightweight and intuitive Neovim plugin designed to
enhance navigation within Markdown files. Whether you're creating study notes,
documentation, or any Markdown-formatted text, this plugin streamlines the
process of moving between sections and headings.

### Key Features

- **Heading List:** Quickly access a clean list of all Markdown and HTML
  headings in your file.
- **Effortless Navigation:** Jump to specific sections with ease, improving
  overall file navigation.
- **Treesitter Integration:** Boosted accuracy through the use of Treesitter
  for parsing Markdown and HTML structures.
- **Customization Options:** Tailor the plugin to your preferences with
  customizable settings, including width, height, border characters, and the
  ability to control auto-closing behavior, and last but not least colors.

### Why it Exists

Markdown Headers emerged from my own struggles and frustrations while working
with extensive Markdown files during exam preparations. As a student who
heavily relies on Markdown for organizing and summarizing course materials,
navigating through numerous headings became a cumbersome task. This plugin is
my response to that challenge.

It exists to offer a practical solution for anyone who regularly works with
Markdown, whether for academic notes, technical documentation, or personal
projects. The goal is to make the Markdown editing experience in Neovim more
enjoyable and efficient, improving your productivity.
