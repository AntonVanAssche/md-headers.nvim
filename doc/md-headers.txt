This plugin helps you to easily navigate between headings in a Markdown file.

To use the Markdown Headers plugin, use the ':MarkdownHeaders' command to display a list of headings in the current buffer in a floating window.
The headings will include both Markdown and HTML headings.
You can navigate to a heading by pressing Enter on it, and the cursor will move to the corresponding heading in the main window.
You can also press Escape or q to close the window.
The window will also close automatically when you've selected a heading.

To start the plugin with the cursor already positioned on the closest heading, use the ':MarkdownHeadersClosest' command instead.

Examples:

>
    MarkdownHeaders
    MarkdownHeadersClosest
