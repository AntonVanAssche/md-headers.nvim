This plugin helps you to easily navigate between headings in a Markdown file.

You can use the 'MarkdownHeaders' command to activate the plugin and display the list of headings (these include Markdown and HTML headings).
The plugin will open a window on the side of the main window, and the headings will be listed in the window.
You can navigate to a heading by pressing Enter on it, and the cursor will move to the corresponding heading in the main window.
You can also press Escape or q to close the window.
The window will also close automatically when you've selected a heading.

For example:

>
    :MarkdownHeaders
<

 vim:tw=78:ts=8:ft=help:norl:
